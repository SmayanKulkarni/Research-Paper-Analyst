ALL IN-TEXT CITATIONS WITH CONTEXT
============================================================

[Context 1]

Introduction**


Subjective listening studies are the most reliable form of speech
quality assessment for many applications, including speech enhancement and audio source separation [1, 2].


[Context 2]

Listeners often
rate the perceptual quality of testing materials using categorical or multi-stimuli rating protocols [3, 4].


[Context 3]

The test materials are often artificially created by additively or convolutionally mixing clean speech with noise or reverberation at prescribed levels, to simulate real environments [5, 6].


[Context 4]

Many
investigations conclude that more realistic datasets and scenarios are needed to improve real-world speech processing performance [7, 8, 9].


[Context 5]

Intrusive measures, such as the perceptual evaluation of speech
quality (PESQ) [10], signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) [2] and
perceptual objective listening quality analysis (POLQA) [11],
generate quality scores by calculating the dissimilarities between a clean reference speech signal and its degraded counterpart (e.g.


[Context 6]

These measures,
however, do not always correlate well with subjective quality
results [12, 13].


[Context 7]

Several non-intrusive (or reference-less) objective quality
measures have been developed, including the ITU-T standard
P.563 [14], ANSI standard ANIQUE+ [15], and the speech to
reverberation modulation energy ratio (SRMR) [16].


[Context 8]

These approaches, however, rely on signal properties and assumptions that are not always realized
in real-world environments, hence the assessment scores are
not always consistent with human ratings [6, 17].


[Context 9]

More recent work uses data-driven methods to estimate speech quality [18, 17, 19, 20, 21].


[Context 10]

The authors in [22] combine handcrafted feature extraction with a tree-based regression model
to predict objective PESQ scores.


[Context 11]

Quality-Net [18] provides
frame-level quality assessment by predicting the utterance-level
PESQ scores that are copied as per-frame labels using a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) network.


[Context 12]

Similarly, NISQA [17] estimates the per-frame POLQA scores using a convolutional neural network (CNN).


[Context 13]

However, the usage of objective quality scores as training
targets is a major limitation, since objective measures only approximate human perception [2, 12].


[Context 14]

Alternatively, the model
developed in [19] predicts the mean opinion score (MOS) [23]

- f human ratings, but the ratings are collected on simulated
speech data.


[Context 15]

In this study, we conduct a large-scale listening test on
real-world data and collect 180,000 subjective quality ratings
through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) [24] using two
publically-available speech corpora [25, 26].


[Context 16]

This platform provides a diverse population of participants at a significantly lower
cost to facilitate accurate and rapid testing [27, 28, 29].


[Context 17]

Our
listening tests follow the MUltiple Stimuli with Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA) protocol [4].


[Context 18]

We additionally develop an encoder-decoder model with attention mechanism [30] to non-intrusively predict the perceived
speech quality of these real-world signals.


[Context 19]

The encoder consists

- f stacked pyramid BLSTMs [31] that convert low-level speech
spectra into high-level features.


[Context 20]

Crowdsourced listening study procedures**


We create human intelligence tasks (HIT) on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) for our crowdsourced subjective listening
test [32], where each HIT is completed by 5 crowdworkers (i.e.


[Context 21]

MUSHRA) [4].


[Context 22]

Speech material**


Previous listening studies use artificially created noisy- or
reverberant-speech stimuli [2, 33, 29, 19].


[Context 23]

We first use the COnversational Speech In Noisy Environments (COSINE) corpus [25].


[Context 24]

We also use the Voices Obscured in Complex Environmental Settings (VOiCES) corpus [26].


[Context 25]

Data cleaning and MOS calculation**


A crowdworker’s responses are rejected if the response contains
malicious behavior [34], such as random scoring or the amount

- f unanswered responses exceeds 20% of the HIT.


[Context 26]

This potentially presents a challenge when trying to
predict opinion scores [35].


[Context 27]

Responses with absolute Z-scores above 2.5 are
identified as potential outliers [36].


[Context 28]

Thus, we apply two robust non-parametric techniques, density based spatial
clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) [37] and isolation forests (IF) [38], to discover outliers that deviate significantly from the majority ratings.


[Context 29]

The
decoder specifies a probability distribution over sequences of
features using an attention mechanism [30].


[Context 30]

The encoder utilizes a stacked pyramid bidirectional long
short term memory (pBLSTM) [31] network, which has been
successfully used in similar speech tasks (ASR [31] and voice
conversion [39]), but not for speech assessment.


[Context 31]

More generally, the pBLSTM model for
calculating the hidden state at layer _l_ and time step _t_ is


_h_ _[l]_ _t_ [= pBLSTM] - _h_ _[l]_ _t−_ 1 _[,]_ [ Concat(] _[h][l]_ _M_ _[−]_ _∗_ [1] _t−M_ +1 _[, .


[Context 32]

., h]_ _M_ _[l][−]_ _∗_ [1] _t_ [)] - _,_
(1)
where _M_ is the reduction factor between successive pBLSTM
layers.


[Context 33]

The factor _M_ = 2
is adopted here, same as [31].


[Context 34]

This structure reduces the time
resolution from the input **x** to the final latent representation **h** **[L]**

by a factor of _M_ [3] = 8.


[Context 35]

The self-attention mechanism [40] uses the encoder output at the _i_ - th and _k_ - th time
steps (e.g., _h_ _[L]_ _i_ and _h_ _[L]_ _k_ [) to compute the attention weights:]
_αi,k_ = Attention( _h_ _[L]_ _i_ _[, h][L]_ _k_ [)][.] A context vector _ci_ is computed as a weighted sum of the encoder hidden states: _ci_ =

- _Tk_ =1 _h_ _[α][i,k][h]_ _k_ _[L]_ [. Note that the pyramid structure of the encoder]
results in shorter latent representations than the original input
sequence, and it leads to fewer encoding states for attention calculation at the decoding stage. Finally, the context vector of the
decoder is passed to a FC layer that has 32 hidden units and
results in an estimate of the perceptual quality (i.e., MOS). The
model is optimized using the mean-squared error loss and Adam

- ptimization. It is trained for 100 epochs. The aforementioned
parameters were empirically determined based on best performance with a validation set.


**3. Experiments and analysis**


**3.1. Experimental setup**


The speech corpora from both datasets consist of 16-bit single
channel files sampled at 16 kHz. For MOS prediction, the input
speech signals are segmented into 40 ms length frames, with 10

ms overlap. A FFT length of 512 samples and a Hanning window are used to compute the spectrogram. Mean and variance
normalization are applied to the input feature vector (i.e., logmagnitude spectrogram). The noisy or reverberant stimuli of
each dataset are divided into training (70%), validation (10%)
and testing (20%) sets, and trained separately. Five fold crossvalidation is used to assess generalize performance to unseen
data.

Four metrics are used to evaluate MOS prediction: the mean
absolute error (MAE); the epsilon insensitive root mean squared
error (RMSE _[⋆]_ ) [41], which incorporates a 95% confidence interval when calculating prediction errors; Pearson’s correlation
coefficient _γ_ (PCC); and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient _ρ_ (SRCC), which assesses monotonicity.


**3.2. Prediction of subjective quality**


The proposed model is denoted as pBLSTM+Attn, and we first
compare with three baseline models. The first model replaces
the pBLSTM layers with conventional BLSTM layers (denoted
as BLSTM+Attn), in order to determine the benefit of the pyramid structure. All other hyper-parameters are kept unchanged.
The second and third baseline models remove the attention

mechanism from the proposed model and the BLSTM model,
respectively, and are denoted as pBLSTM and BLSTM. These
models assesses how much the attention module contributes to

the overall performance.
The results for the baseline and proposed models are presented in Table I. It can be seen that, on average, the proposed
model outperforms all baseline models according to all metrics.
The pyramid architecture (pBLSTM) improves the performance

- f the encoder, since it captures global and local dependencies
in the latent representation space. This results in average correlations of _ρ_ = 0 _._ 89 and _γ_ = 0 _._ 88 with pBLSTM+Attn, which
are much higher than the _ρ_ = 0 _._ 53 and _γ_ = 0 _._ 52 with BLSTM,
and _ρ_ = 0 _._ 80 and _γ_ = 0 _._ 79 with BLSTM+Attn model. The
influence of attention is observed by comparing BLSTM or
pBLSTM performance with their attention counterparts. For
instance, the RMSE _[⋆]_ drops from 0.96 for the BLSTM to 0.74
for the BLSTM+Att. pBLSTM+Attn reduces the MAE from
0.79 to 0.51 and increases the PCC from 0.56 to 0.89, due to the
incorporation of an attention layer. These results further confirm the effectiveness of the attention module. A statistical sig

nificance test indicates these results are statistically significant
( _p_ - value _<_ 0 _._ 0001).
Next, we compare our model with six non-intrusive meth
- ds, including two conventional measures that are based on
voice production and perception, and four data-driven approaches that utilize deep learning. P.563 [14] essentially detects degradations by a vocal tract model and then reconstructs
a clean reference signal. SRMR [16] is an auditory-inspired
model which utilizes the modulation envelopes of the speech
signal to quantify speech quality. Since the output ranges of
P.563 and SRMR are different from our scaled MOS (i.e., 0
to 10), a 3rd order polynomial mapping suggested by ITU
P.1401 [41] is used to compensate the outputs when calculating MAE and RMSE _[⋆]_ . AutoMOS [42] consists of a stack of
two LSTMs and takes a log-Mel spectrogram as input. QualityNet [18] uses one BLSTM and two FC layers. NISQA [17] uses
a combination of six CNN and two BLSTM layers. In [19], a
deep neural network (DNN) with four hidden layers is used,
where it generates utterance-level MOS estimates from the
frame-level predictions. Each of these approaches are trained
with the same data split as the proposed model to predict the
MOS scores, using the approach’s default parameters.
As can be seen from the results in Table II, all data-driven
approaches outperform the conventional measures (i.e., P.563
and SRMR) with a good margin. This is due, in great part, by
the fact that conventional measures do rely on the assumptions
that are not always true in real environments, while the datadriven approaches are able to learn informative features automatically.
When comparing to recent data-driven approaches, the proposed model achieves the highest performance in terms of
both prediction error and the correlations with the ground-truth
MOS, except for SRCC of the DNN model on VOiCES data
( _γ_ = 0.86). The proposed model, however, achieves higher correlations, _ρ_ = 0 _._ 91 and _γ_ = 0 _._ 90 than the _ρ_ = 0 _._ 85 and
_γ_ = 0 _._ 86 of the DNN model on COSINE data. The PCC of the
proposed model also far exceeds the 0.75 of AutoMOS and 0.82

- f Quality-Net. Similar trends occur on VOiCES data as well.

pBLSTM+Attn improves the PCC to 0.88, compared to AutoMOS with 0.76, Quality-Net with 0.81, and NISQA with 0.84.
Additionally, the proposed pBLSTM+Attn achieves RMSE _[⋆]_

- f 0.52 and 0.61 on COSINE and VOICES data, respectively,
which clearly outperforms the 0.83 and 0.78 of AutoMOS, the
0.70 and 0.72 of Quality-Net, and 0.65 and 0.70 of DNN. Our
MAE and RMSE _[⋆]_ scores are also lower than NISQA. Our
model shows statistical significance (e.g. _p <_ 0 _._ 01) against
all approaches and metrics, except for MAE and RMSE _[⋆]_ - n
the COSINE data with NISQA where the _p_ - values are 0.047
and 0.078, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed
attention enhanced pyramidal architecture improves prediction
performance, and obtains higher correlations and lower prediction errors to other data-driven approaches.
Fig. 3, displays the relationship between the subjective
MOS and the estimated MOS of the proposed approach. It can
be seen that most predicted values scatter along the diagonal,
which indicates high correlation with human MOS assessments.


**4. Conclusions**


In this paper, we present a data-driven approach to evaluate
speech quality, by directly predicting human MOS ratings of
real-world speech signals. A large-scale speech quality study
is conducted using crowdsourcing to ensure that our prediction
model performs accurately and robustly in real-world environments. An attention-based pyramid recurrent model is trained to
estimate MOS. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in contrast to the baseline models
and several state-of-the-art methods in terms of speech quality
evaluation. The collected dataset will also be made available to

facilitate future research efforts.

💡 CLARITY OF THOUGHT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I now can give a great answer

**Final Answer**

**Overall Clarity Score: 8/10**

The paper is well-structured, and the authors have made a significant effort to present their ideas clearly. However, there are some areas where the clarity could be improved.

**Assessment of Main Argument Clarity**

The main argument is clearly stated in the abstract: "A Pyramid Recurrent Network for Predicting Crowdsourced Speech-Quality Ratings of Real-World Signals." The paper aims to develop a novel approach to predict human quality ratings of real-world speech signals using a pyramid bidirectional long short-term memory (pBLSTM) network with an attention mechanism.

The problem statement is well-defined in the introduction, highlighting the limitations of current objective measures and the need for a more realistic approach. The research questions are also well-defined, focusing on the development of a novel approach to predict human quality ratings of real-world speech signals.

**Analysis of Logical Reasoning Quality**

The logical reasoning is generally sound, with a clear chain of reasoning from the introduction to the conclusion. The authors have provided a thorough review of the related work, highlighting the limitations of current approaches and the need for a more realistic approach.

However, there are some areas where the logical reasoning could be improved. For example, in the introduction, the authors state that "many investigations conclude that more realistic datasets and scenarios are needed to improve real-world speech processing performance." However, they do not provide a clear explanation of how their proposed approach addresses this need.

Additionally, in the results section, the authors compare their proposed approach with several baseline models and state-of-the-art methods. However, they do not provide a clear explanation of why their approach is superior to the others.

**Specific Examples of Unclear or Illogical Passages**

1. In the introduction, the authors state that "the simulated data does not capture all the intricate details of real environments (e.g. speaker and environmental characteristics)." However, they do not provide a clear explanation of how their proposed approach addresses this limitation.
2. In the results section, the authors state that "the proposed pBLSTM+Attn achieves RMSE [⋆] of 0.52 and 0.61 on COSINE and VOICES data, respectively." However, they do not provide a clear explanation of what RMSE [⋆] means or why this is a significant result.
3. In the conclusion, the authors state that "the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in contrast to the baseline models and several state-of-the-art methods in terms of speech quality evaluation." However, they do not provide a clear explanation of why their approach is superior to the others.

**Recommendations for Improving Clarity and Logical Flow**

1. Provide a clear explanation of how the proposed approach addresses the limitations of current approaches.
2. Provide a clear explanation of the significance of the results, including the meaning of RMSE [⋆] and why this is a significant result.
3. Provide a clear explanation of why the proposed approach is superior to the others, including a comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
4. Consider adding more visual aids, such as figures and tables, to help illustrate the key points and make the paper more engaging.
5. Consider adding more context to the paper, including a brief overview of the background and motivation for the research.

Overall, the paper is well-written and presents a clear and compelling argument. However, there are some areas where the clarity could be improved, and the logical reasoning could be strengthened. With some revisions, the paper could be even more effective in communicating the authors' ideas and results.

I now can give a great answer

**Final Answer**

**Overall Readability Score:** 7/10

The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, but there are some areas where the narrative flow could be improved. The use of technical terms and jargon may make it challenging for non-experts to understand certain sections.

**Assessment of Narrative Arc and Structure:**

The paper tells a coherent story, but the narrative arc could be more engaging. The introduction sets the stage for the problem, but the transition to the proposed solution could be smoother. The conclusion effectively summarizes the main findings, but it feels a bit abrupt.

**Analysis of Transitions Quality:**

Transitions between sections are generally smooth, but there are some areas where the narrative jumps abruptly. For example, the transition from the introduction to the proposed solution could be more gradual. Additionally, some sections feel disconnected from the rest of the paper.

**Specific Examples of Flow Problems:**

1. The transition from the introduction to the proposed solution (Section 1 to Section 4) feels abrupt. The reader is suddenly presented with a new idea without a clear connection to the previous section.
2. The section on data cleaning and MOS calculation (Section 5) feels disconnected from the rest of the paper. The reader is not provided with enough context to understand the importance of this section.
3. The use of technical terms and jargon may make it challenging for non-experts to understand certain sections. For example, the explanation of the pyramid bidirectional long short-term memory (pBLSTM) network is dense and may require additional context.
4. The paper jumps between different ideas and concepts without providing a clear connection between them. For example, the section on the proposed model is followed by a section on the experimental results, but the reader is not provided with enough context to understand how the two sections are related.

**Recommendations for Improving Narrative Flow and Readability:**

1. Use transitional phrases and sentences to connect ideas and concepts between sections.
2. Provide more context and background information to help non-experts understand technical terms and jargon.
3. Use clear and concise language to explain complex concepts.
4. Use visual aids, such as figures and tables, to help illustrate complex ideas and concepts.
5. Use a more gradual transition from the introduction to the proposed solution.
6. Use a clear and concise conclusion that summarizes the main findings and provides a clear direction for future research.

**Specific Recommendations for Improving Narrative Flow:**

1. Add a transitional sentence or phrase to connect the introduction to the proposed solution (Section 1 to Section 4).
2. Add a brief explanation of the importance of data cleaning and MOS calculation (Section 5) to provide context for the reader.
3. Use clear and concise language to explain the pyramid bidirectional long short-term memory (pBLSTM) network.
4. Use a clear and concise conclusion that summarizes the main findings and provides a clear direction for future research.

**Specific Recommendations for Improving Readability:**

1. Use clear and concise language throughout the paper.
2. Avoid using technical terms and jargon without providing sufficient context.
3. Use visual aids, such as figures and tables, to help illustrate complex ideas and concepts.
4. Use a clear and concise writing style to make the paper easier to follow.

By implementing these recommendations, the paper can be improved to make it more engaging, easier to follow, and more accessible to a wider audience.
